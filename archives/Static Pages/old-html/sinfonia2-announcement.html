            <p><img alt="" src="images/visual_sinfonia_1.png" class="fl" />            </p>
            <p> Ever since we introduced Sinfonia in 2000, RMS has blazed the trail for orchestra enhancement of musical theatre. We're proud to have earned the trust of  luminaries such as Cameron Mackintosh, Cirque du Solieil, The Leonard Bernstein Organization, The Gershwins and many, many more. As the technology behind Music Theatre International's <em>OrchExtra</em>, Rodgers and Hammerstein's <em>InstrumentalEase</em> and the musical enhancement of dozens of major professional productions and tours, Sinfonia has built an unparalleled track record of hundreds of thousands of performances. We are so grateful to our many customers and friends, without whom this exciting business would be impossible.</p>
            <p>Throughout our history, we have listened carefully to customer feedback. We steadily added  features at your direct request. We  also spend much of our days thinking about what  the musical theatre community wants, what challenges can we help address, and how we can create a better experience for the performers and the audience - in short, how can we improve. <br />
          </p>
<p>A little over five years ago, we embarked on a ground-up redesign of our software. We wanted to take advantage of everything we had learned and  accomplished. But we wanted to make it even easier, cleaner, more intuitive. We also had a bunch of new ideas we wanted to bring to the fore. We are now ready to unveil: Sinfonia 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Something great just got even better!</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sinfonia 2 is truly a quantum leap forward. It still has all the real-time live performance features that established it as an industry leader. But there are also hundreds of new features giving even more powerful and flexible customization. Among them are:</p>

                      <li>and that's just scratching the surface!</li>

<h1>Download it and use with your own gear.</h1>
<p>Probablly the most significant advantage of Sinfonia 2 is that it's available online and may be used with your own equipment. You no longer need to rent gear from us when you book Sinfonia. That means:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
        <li>We can charge less.</li>
                      <li>You can use it longer (virtually unlimited rehearsal).</li>
                      <li>You can take advantage of the most sophisticated sound technology available, if you want an ultra-sophisticated treatment.</li>
                      <li>You can put it on multiple computers for added rehearsal flexibility and backup safety.</li>
                      <li>You can try it for free.</li> 
                      
                  </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <h1>&quot;Did you say try it for free?&quot;</h1>
